# Summary

In the past years, Brazilian football national league seems to face a decrease in the quality of the games. Trying to address this assumption, the presented visualization shows the average number of goals scored by the teams each year since 2003 in the main football leagues. Through a multiline chart, it is suggested that, in fact, Brazilian national league has been suffering a decrease in the number of scored goals, while other leagues have maintained or increased their scoring levels. Considering that the number of goals in a football match impacts the general quality, this visualization supports the hypothesis that Brazilian national football suffers a quality crisis. However, it is worth pointing out that the visualization is not trying to suggest that goals scored that affect the quality of football games, meaning that other metrics should be analyzed and visualized as well.

# Design

## Chart Type

The visualization main objective is to convey that the game quality of the Brazilian national league has been decreasing in the last years. This way, a line chart seems a good choice given that it allows illustrating the trend of the number of goals scored during the time interval analyzed.

It is also important to compare the trend of the Brazilian national league with other leagues so that any global trend causing a lower global football quality in the last years may be visualized. Soon, a multiline chart fits this matter as it allows to compare various national football leagues trends over time. 

## Color Encoding

Considering that the national leagues are categorical variables, they are represented by a color scale.

Besides, the color encoding combined with interactive, enable users to focus the visualizations on the desired leagues as other leagues are assigned a neutral gray color.

## Interactivity

As mentioned briefly in the Color Encoding section, users are allowed to interact with the visualization through a toggling legend mechanism. Users may toggle the lines of national leagues by clicking on the respective legend labels. Thereby, the visualization focus relies only on the desired leagues meaning that the other leagues don't distract the users.

# Feedbacks

## Feedback 1

Users should be able to toggle the lines by clicking on the lines, in addition to clicking on the respective legend label.

## Feedback 2

The *x axis* label should be changed so users have a better understanding of the metric being visualized. The chosen label *"Goals per Team"* is somewhat unclear about the metric represented meaning.

## Feedback 3

The *"Summary"* section should be rephrased because it sounds like that the average goals scored is the only variable that impacts the quality of the performance of Brazilian football players.
